# pi-math

Render LaTeX in the Pi TUI as real, transparent terminal images.

pi-math uses MathJax for mathematical typesetting and Resvg for rasterization. It does not approximate formulas with Unicode glyphs or hand-built character geometry.

## Features

- Genuine LaTeX layout through MathJax SVG
- Transparent, theme-colored PNG output through Resvg
- True inline image formulas in Kitty and Ghostty through Unicode virtual placements
- Compatible Kitty graphics and iTerm2 display-image placement through Pi TUI
- Inline delimiters: `$...$` and `\(...\)`
- Display delimiters: `$$...$$` and `\[...\]`
- Common display environments, including `equation`, `align`, `aligned`, `gather`, matrices, cases, and amscd `CD` diagrams
- Native MathJax support for fractions, roots, scripts, limits, scalable fences, `\boxed`, and nested structures
- One consistent base formula size across messages
- Minimum necessary proportional shrinking when a formula exceeds the content width
- Cell-aware centering and automatic rerendering after terminal resize
- Alpha-bound clipping detection, dynamic raster density, and minimal adaptive transparent safety bleed
- Separate byte-bounded SVG and PNG caches
- Configurable TeX macros, environments, font files, and cross-platform system-font discovery
- Original LaTeX fallback when image rendering or a formula is unsupported
- Display-only transformation: stored messages and model context are never rewritten
- Local, in-process rendering with no browser, network request, or child process at runtime

## Requirements

- Pi 0.80.6 or newer
- Node.js 22.19 or newer
- A terminal image protocol recognized by Pi:
  - Full inline and display rendering: Ghostty and Kitty
  - Display rendering plus compatibility inline placement: WezTerm and Warp
  - Display rendering: iTerm2

Pi intentionally disables terminal images inside tmux and screen. In those environments, and in terminals without a supported image protocol, pi-math leaves the original LaTeX visible.

## Installation

Install the npm package:

```bash
pi install npm:@monotykamary/pi-math
```

Or clone the repository into Pi's global extension directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-math.git \
  ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-math
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-math
bun install --production
```

Or keep the checkout elsewhere and symlink it:

```bash
cd /path/to/pi-math
bun install --production
ln -sfn "$PWD" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-math
```

Reload Pi after installation:

```text
/reload
```

Pi discovers `src/index.ts` through the `pi.extensions` field in `package.json`.

## Usage

Use normal LaTeX delimiters in user or assistant messages:

```markdown
Euler's identity is $e^{i\pi}+1=0$.

\[
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
f(x)&=(x-a)q(x)+r,\\
f(a)&=r.
\end{aligned}
\]
```

Ghostty and Kitty render embedded formulas as real one-row image cells, so prose, punctuation, and list items remain intact. Standalone and display formulas use centered image blocks. Other terminals use the safest protocol-specific behavior available; the Markdown source always remains unchanged.

## Commands

```text
/math-render status   Show protocol, raster count, cache bytes, and last failure
/math-render on       Enable image rendering
/math-render off      Disable image rendering
/math-render clear    Clear formula and Markdown transform caches
```

Rendering is enabled by default.

## Sizing behavior

Every formula starts at the same base scale: `0.50 × terminal cell height` pixels per MathJax `ex`.

- Formulas that fit use that scale unchanged.
- Formulas are never enlarged to fill available space.
- An overwide formula is reduced only enough to fit the current Markdown content width.
- Width and height always use the same scale, preserving the complete formula's aspect ratio.
- The raster is padded, not stretched, to an exact integer number of terminal cells.
- Embedded inline formulas are proportionally contained in one terminal row so they can share a line with text.
- Small rasters use 2× device density; exceptionally large terminal canvases fall back to 1× instead of failing.

Resizing the terminal creates a layout-specific render. A formula returns to the base scale whenever the wider content area can contain it.

## Optional configuration

Configuration is read when the extension loads:

```text
PI_MATH_MACROS          JSON object of MathJax configmacros definitions
PI_MATH_ENVIRONMENTS    JSON object of MathJax custom environment definitions
PI_MATH_FONT_FILES      Font files separated by the platform path delimiter
PI_MATH_SYSTEM_FONTS    true/false; enabled by default for Unicode text fallback
PI_MATH_COLOR           Explicit formula ink color as #rrggbb
```

Formula ink follows the surrounding Markdown text: the component's own default text color when present (for example, custom message text), otherwise the active Pi theme's `text` token. Pi's built-in dark and light themes therefore give matching formula colors in both modes, and custom themes with a concrete `text` token work the same way. Themes that leave `text` at the terminal default get a mode-appropriate neutral color; set `PI_MATH_COLOR` to pin an exact value. Pi's transient italic reasoning stream keeps source LaTeX instead of rasterizing formulas that are rebuilt on every token.

Macro names may be written with or without the leading backslash. Explicit font files are validated before renderer initialization. System font discovery is performed in-process by Resvg and contains no platform-specific hardcoded paths. Reload Pi after changing these variables.

## Fallback behavior

pi-math leaves the original delimiters and LaTeX visible when:

- Pi reports no supported image protocol;
- rendering is disabled with `/math-render off`;
- MathJax rejects incomplete or unsupported input;
- a safety limit is exceeded; or
- the renderer cannot initialize on the current platform.

Fallback is source-preserving; there is no Unicode approximation path.

## How it works

```text
Markdown LaTeX
    ↓ protected span detection
MathJax TeX → SVG
    ↓ fixed scale or minimum width fit
Resvg → transparent PNG on an integer-cell canvas
    ↓
Pi TUI image placement
    ↓
Kitty Unicode placeholders / Kitty graphics / iTerm2 images
```

Pi does not currently expose a renderer override for ordinary user and assistant messages. pi-math therefore installs a reversible wrapper around `Markdown.render()`. It swaps protected markers into the render pass, inserts terminal image sequences, and restores the original Markdown before returning.

### Streaming render extensions

Extensions like [pi-streaming-guard](https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-streaming-guard) replace `Markdown.render()` wholesale instead of chaining through previous wrappers, which would bypass formula rendering. pi-math cooperates: after session startup settles and at the start of every turn it re-asserts itself as the outermost renderer and delegates into whichever render is active underneath, so the guard's incremental token caching and pi-math's formula images compose without configuration. Toggling the guard mid-session heals on the next turn at the latest. Completed formulas keep stable image IDs across append-only assistant deltas, so Pi's differential renderer does not retransmit every earlier PNG as later tokens arrive.

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for module boundaries, cache behavior, sizing invariants, and failure handling.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run check
bun run visual -- gallery
bun run visual -- radical
bun run visual -- aligned
bun run visual -- complex
bun run visual -- theory
bun run visual -- inline
```

Set `MATH_WIDTH` to exercise a specific Markdown width:

```bash
MATH_WIDTH=60 bun run visual -- theory
```

The automated suite covers MathJax rasterization, transparent ink bounds, fixed and width-limited scales, one-row inline fitting, dynamic raster density, tall formulas, macros, tags, Unicode text, malformed-input diagnostics, nested/commented TeX scanning, Markdown code exclusion, Kitty Unicode placeholders, Kitty/iTerm2 compatibility placement, capability fallback, resize layout, byte-bounded LRU behavior, cache stability, source restoration, and patch removal.

## Runtime dependencies

- [MathJax 3](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src) — TeX parsing and SVG layout, Apache-2.0

`@resvg/resvg-js` uses platform-specific native packages. Installation must include the matching optional dependency for the target operating system and architecture.
