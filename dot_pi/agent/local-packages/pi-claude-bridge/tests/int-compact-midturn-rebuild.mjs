// Regression: a compaction that lands *inside* a turn must reach Claude Code (issue #101).
//
// pi checks the compaction threshold at every turn boundary of a run, not only
// between user prompts: agent-session's prepareNextTurnWithContext calls
// _compactBeforeNextAssistantResponse after the tool results are in and before
// the next assistant request. One pi turn is one Claude Code query, and that
// query holds its own context inside the CLI subprocess — so pi shrinking its
// transcript does nothing to it. The bridge then delivered the tool result into
// that still-running query, which answered off the pre-compaction context,
// reported the pre-compaction usage back to pi, and tripped the threshold again
// at the next boundary: one tool call of progress per compaction, forever.
//
// Reported twice with numbers (#101): cacheRead 123,261 → 131,271 across seven
// compactions on a 140K window, and tokensBefore 184,838 → 216,810 across
// fourteen on a 200K one. Neither ever dropped.
//
// Determinism: the compaction has to fire mid-turn, and pi also checks the
// threshold before a prompt is submitted. So auto-compaction starts *off* and is
// switched on from the test at the first tool execution of the measured turn —
// by then the turn is running and the pre-prompt check is behind us, so the next
// boundary inside the run is the one that compacts.
//
// The threshold is calibrated, not guessed: a probe run measures what one
// minimal turn through this bridge actually costs (the Claude Code preset, the
// served pi tools, the transcript), and the threshold is set that far plus a
// margin, so a seeded turn that reads two ~48KB files is over it while the
// compacted history is comfortably under.
//
// Expected:
//   - RED (bug present): the first usage Claude Code reports after the
//     compaction is the pre-compaction context, near-unchanged.
//   - GREEN (fixed): the query is discarded at the boundary and the turn
//     continues from a rebuilt session, so that usage drops to roughly the
//     compacted history, and the turn still finishes with its marker.
