// A pi shutdown has to take the Claude Code subprocess with it.
//
// The SDK spawns `claude` with plain pipes and no parent-death watchdog. CC does
// exit on stdin EOF while it is merely waiting on an API response — but not while
// a tool call is parked: its MCP transport is gone, so CC reads each tool call as
// an ordinary tool error, feeds it to the model and issues another API request,
// forever. Two incidents in the 2026-07-29 audit ran 59 and 23 minutes, and one
// consumed enough quota to trip an account-wide 429. See diag/AUDIT.md, "Not
// covered by these scripts".
//
// So the repro shuts pi down with a tool call in flight. Nothing throws when this
// regresses and the pi-side logs simply stop, so the assertion is on the process
// table.
