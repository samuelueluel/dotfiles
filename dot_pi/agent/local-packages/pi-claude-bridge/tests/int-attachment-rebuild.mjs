// Integration test: an `@file` expansion survives a session rebuild.
//
// Claude Code expands an at-mention itself and stores the file's contents as a
// `type: "attachment"` record in its own session file. pi never sees it, so a
// rebuild from pi's history used to drop the file while keeping the prompt text
// that referred to it — the model silently lost something it was reasoning about.
//
// This drives the real thing rather than the plumbing: it asks Claude Code, over
// a resumed session, for a token that exists *only* inside the carried
// attachment. If the attachment did not reach the rebuilt session, CC cannot
// answer, because the token appears nowhere else in the conversation.
//
// The control matters as much as the assertion. The same rebuild without
// carrying the attachment must fail to produce the token — otherwise the test
// would pass for the wrong reason (CC reading the file off disk, guessing from
// the prompt, or the token leaking through some other path).
//
// Requires: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or CC logged in.
